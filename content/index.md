# Who am I?
I am a BS Pharmacy students (as of S.Y. 2024-2025). You can call me Juxt. My senior high school experience changed me and inspired me to not only achieve academically but also to assist academically.

This is a publicized version of my class notes. I did this so I could pass my notes along to those interested. 

Even though my notes are made primarily for BS Pharmacy students, if any of the notes are useful to you regardless of course, feel free to browse it as much as you want.
