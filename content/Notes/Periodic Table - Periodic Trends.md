According to [[Periodic Table - Basics and Brief History#Periodic Law|Periodic Law]], arranging our elements in increasing atomic number ( like how it is arranged in the Periodic Table ), we begin to see patterns in the elemental characteristics, that is called a Periodic Trend.

Below are the Periodic Trends in the Periodic Table
### Electronegativity
Electronegativity is the tendency for an atom of a given chemical element to attract shared electrons when forming a chemical bond.

The difference in electronegativity between two elements in a bond will determine its type of bond and its strength.

| Type of Bond       | Difference in Electronegativity |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Non-Polar Covalent | $0-0.4$                         |
| Polar Covalent     | $0.4â€“2$                         |
| Ionic Bonds        | $>2$                            |
Electronegativity increases as you move from left to right ( $\rightarrow$ ) and as you move up a group ( $\uparrow$ ).
### Ionization Energy
Ionization Energy is the amount of energy that is required to remove a valence electron from an isolated atom in a gaseous state.

Ionization Energy increases as you move from left to right ( $\rightarrow$ ) and as you move up a group ( $\uparrow$ ).
### Electron Affinity
Electron Affinity is the tendency to more easily accept electrons and form negative ions or anions.

Electron Affinity increases as you move from left to right ( $\rightarrow$ ) and as you move up a group ( $\uparrow$ ).
### Atomic Radius
Atomic Radius is the total distance from the nucleus of an atom to the outmost orbital of its electrons.

Atomic radius increases you move right to left ( $\leftarrow$ ) and as move down a group ( $\downarrow$ ).
### Metallic Character
Metallic Character is the tendency to lose an electron in a bond and form positive ions or cations.

Metallic Character increases as you move from right to left ( $\rightarrow$ ) and as you move down a group ( $\downarrow$ ).
