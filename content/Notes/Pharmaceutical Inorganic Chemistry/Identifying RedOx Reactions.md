# What is a Redox Reaction
An oxidation–reduction or redox reaction is a reaction that involves the transfer of electrons between chemical species (the atoms, ions, or molecules involved in the reaction).

It is composed of two reactions occurring simultaneously; the reactions in question are the: reduction reaction and oxidation reaction.

Redox reactions are in processes present in every day life, such as the burning of fuels, corrosion of metals, and even the process of photosynthesis.

# Process of a Redox Reaction
During a redox reaction, some species undergo oxidation, or the loss of electrons; while others undergo reduction, or the gain of electrons.

In this given reaction ( the rusting of iron ):

$$4\text{Fe}(s)+3\text{O}_2(g)\longrightarrow2\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3(s)$$

We can observe the following:
- in the left hand side: $\text{Fe}$ has an oxidation state of $0$ because it is not bonded to anything;
- also in the left hand side: $\text{O}$ has an oxidation state of $0$ because it is not bonded to anything;
- on the right hand side: $\text{Fe}$ has an oxidation state of $+3$ through the criss-cross method;
- also on the right hand side: $\text{O}$ has an oxidation state of $-2$ through the criss-cross method;

This brings us to the conclusion that $\text{Fe}$ is oxidized and $\text{O}$ is reduced.
# Oxidation Numbers
Oxidation numbers or oxidation states are the key sign that identifies which species are oxidants and reductant.

# Key Definitions
- **Reduction**
	- a reaction that involves the gaining of electrons;
- **Oxidation**
	- a reaction that involves the losing of electrons;
- **Redox**
	- a simultaneous reaction of reduction and oxidation;
- **Oxidation States**
	- the number that describes the degree of oxidation an atom has in a chemical compound;
	- it is written as a superscript; and denotes the subscript of the atom of polyatomic ion it is bonded with;
- **Reductant**
	- the species that undergoes oxidation and encourages reduction;
- **Oxidant**
	- the species that undergoes reduction and encourages oxidation;
