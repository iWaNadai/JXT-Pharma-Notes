# The Dignity of the Human Person
> "Humans persons willed by God; they are imprinted with God's image. Their dignity does not comes from the work they do, but from the persons they are." - Pope John Paul II

Dignity is an inherent trait of all of God's creations, especially humans. Dignity dictats that we are unique and priceless and our value is not ruined by what we do because we are inherently of value in the eyes of God.

> "Things have a price and can be for sale, but people have a dignity that is prieless and worth far more than things." - Pope Francis

Even if society can place a price on an object, even people can be given a price by society, we are inherently priceless and unique and cannot be given any measurable monetary value.

We are inherently unique, even twins share unique traits that set them apart. The disabled individuals are not seen as beneath us or undignified because of their lackings, but are seen as equal to us in the eyes of God, The Almighty Father.

## Notions about Human Dignity
Human dignity is a person's possession of basic rights:
- The essential rights to clothing and shelter.
- The right to free self-expression within the context of social cooperation.
- The right to basic equality before the law.

Human dignity is the natural worth of a person as a creature formed in the image and likeness of God.

Human dignity is inviolable in a sense that our inherent worth cannot be violated, broken, infringed, or dishonored.

Human dignity is inalienable in a sense that it cannot be removed or given away by any individual.
## The Nature of Human Dignity
### Inherited
It is something given to us by God, we inherit it from God.
### Inviolable
It cannot be violated, no one has the right to violate or profane it.
### Inalienable
It is an essential part of every Human being that cannot be taken away.
## The Sacredness of Life

## Essential Figures
### St. Thomas Aquinas ( 1225-1275 )
He refined th understanding of the human person being created in God's image by interpreting Genesis to teach that the human person is an:

>"Intelligent being endowed with free will and self-movement"

The human person has a soul which endows him/her with the ability to know and love God freely, thereby having a privileged place in the order of creation.
