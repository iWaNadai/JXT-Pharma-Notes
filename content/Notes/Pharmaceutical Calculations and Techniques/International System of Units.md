# Systems of Measurements used in Pharmacy
In Pharmacy, three notable systems of measurement exist:
1. Metric or International System of Units
2. Apothecaries' System
3. Avoirdupois System

In practice, the Metric or International System of Units is the only acceptable system of measurement in pharmacy and medicine; though knowledge of the other two major systems ( Apothecaries' and Avoirdupois ) is essential because of their heavy use in commerce and daily life.
## Metric or International Systems of Units
This system is the internationally recognized decimal system of weights and measurements.

This system is advantageous for its use of a definitive or primary unit for measurement; variations can be made through the use of appropriate prefixes.

This system is the system of choice for pharmacy and medicine; since it is a decimal system, derived units can be generated as a 10th power multiple of the base unit.

### Prescription Writing Style Using the SI Units
![[Rx Example.jpg]]
## Apothecary System
This system was commonly used in the past by pharmacists and physicians and the standard system of weights and measures for dispensing medications.

Despite being largely replaced by SI Units, it is still commonly used in a variety of products.

### Writing Apothecary Units
In the Apothecary System of Units, quantities are written with the units first, followed by the quantity written in roman numerals.

Example: $$\text{3 fluid dram}=\text{flʒ}\text{ iii}$$
### Apothecaries' Measures of Volume and Weight
### Measures of Volume

| Unit                                                    | Equivalent Unit                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 60 minims ($\text{min lx}$  )                           | 1 fluid dram ( $\text{flʒ i}$ )                    |
| 8 fluid drams  ( $\text{flʒ viii}$ )                    | 1 fluid ounce ( $\text{fl℥ i}$ or $1\text{fl oz}$) |
| 16 fluid ounces ( $\text{fl℥ xvi}$ or $16\text{fl oz}$) | 1 pint ( $\text{pt i}$ or $\text{O i}$ )           |
| 2 pints ( $\text{pt ii}$ or $\text{O ii}$ )             | 1 quart ( $\text{qt i}$ )                          |
| 4 quarts ( $\text{qt iv}$ )                             | 1 gallon ( $1\text{gal }$ or $\text{C i}$ )        |
### Measures of Weight

| Unit                          | Equivalent Unit            |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 20 grains ( $\text{gr xx}$ )  | 1 scruple ( $\text{℈ i}$ ) |
| 3 scruples ( $\text{℈ iii}$ ) | 1 dram ( $\text{ʒ i}$ )    |
| 8 drams ( $\text{ʒ viii}$ )   | 1 ounce ( $\text{℥ i}$ )   |
| 12 ounces ( $\text{℥ xii}$ )  | 1 pound ( $\text{℔ i}$ )   |
## Avoirdupois System
This is another system of measurement like the Metric and Apothecaries' System, but this system is just a system of weight measurements.

Just like the Apothecaries' system, the base unit is the grain ( $gr$ ).

The Avoirdupois ounce and pound differ in weight and symbols from those of the Apothecaries' system.

The Avoirdupois pound is the pound we are all accustomed to in our daily lives. 

The Avoirdupois pound is the weight measure in which bulk chemicals and over the counter pharmaceuticals are bought and sold; whereas the Apothecaries' ounce is only used in prescriptions or medication orders.
