# Density
Density is described as the amount of mass per unit volume. It used the unit $\text{g}/\text{mL}$ and can be calculated using the formula below:

# Specific Gravity
Specific gravity is the unit-less ratio of the weight of a substance to the weight of equal volume of a standard substance. 

The standard substance for solids and liquids is water, and for gases it is hydrogen.

Specific gravity can be calculated using the formula below:

# Specific Volume
Specific volume is similar to specific gravity, but it represents the unit-less ratio of volume compared to the volume of a standard substance of equal weight.

It can be calculated by reciprocating a substance's specific gravity or using the formula below:
