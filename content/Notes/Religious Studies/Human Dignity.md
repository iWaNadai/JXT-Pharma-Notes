# The Dignity of the Human Person
> "Humans persons willed by God; they are imprinted with God's image. Their dignity does not comes from the work they do, but from the persons they are." - Centessimus Annus, 11

Dignity is an inherent trait of all of God's creations, especially humans. Dignity dictats that we are unique and priceless and our value is not ruined by what we do because we are inherently of value in the eyes of God.

> "Things have a price and can be for sale, but people have a dignity that is pricelesseless and worth far more than things." - Pope Francis

Even if society can place a price on an object, even people can be given a price by society, we are inherently priceless and unique and cannot be given any measurable monetary value.

We are inherently unique, even twins share unique traits that set them apart. The disabled individuals are not seen as beneath us or undignified because of their shortcomings, but are seen as equal to us in the eyes of God, The Almighty Father.

## Notions about Human Dignity
Human dignity is a person's possession of basic rights:
- The essential rights to clothing and shelter.
- The right to free self-expression within the context of social cooperation.
- The right to basic equality before the law.

Human dignity is the natural worth of a person as a creature formed in the image and likeness of God.

Human dignity is inviolable in a sense that our inherent worth cannot be violated, broken, infringed, or dishonored.

Human dignity is inalienable in a sense that it cannot be removed or given away by any individual.
## The Nature of Human Dignity
### Inherited
It is something given to us by God, we inherit it from God.
### Inviolable
It cannot be violated, no one has the right to violate or profane it.
### Inalienable
It is an essential part of every Human being that cannot be taken away.
## Essential Figures
### St. Thomas Aquinas ( 1225-1275 )
He refined th understanding of the human person being created in God's image by interpreting Genesis to teach that the human person is an:

>"Intelligent being endowed with free will and self-movement"

The human person has a soul which endows him/her with the ability to know and love God freely, thereby having a privileged place in the order of creation.
## The Sacredness of Life
Life is the clearest and most central manifestation of God among us; for it is a gift given from Him to us. It is the transcendent value and worth of every person that comes from God.

Human dignity is therefor the basic respect of person that manifest life. The respect that allows our fellow man to develop their own potential; and to make some personal contribution to common goals and to feel a home in an environment within which they are known and acknowledge.

To respect a person and their human dignity is to acknowledge their personal worth and to act in a way to develop it. Human dignity states that we have our own personal worth and that society is tasked with developing that worth.

Human dignity dictates that despite the social, economic, physical, emotional, or mental handicaps do not lessen a person's human dignity; and does not warrant or justify disrespect onto them. Many methods, such as Special Education show that handicaps can be worked around and will not fully disable a person.
### Reason
It refers to the faculty that has the capacity to grasp truth and knowledge of the good.
### Freedom
It refers to the inner power that is rooted in reason and will, to act or not to act, to do this and that, and so to perform deliberate actions on one's own responsibility ( CCC 1731 ).
### Conscience
It refers to the written law in the hearts of men that commands to do good and avoid evil ( CCC 177 ).
## Biblical Sources of Human Dignity
### Genesis
> "God created man in His image, in the divine image He created him, male and female, He created them." - Genesis 1:27

> "Humans are Imago Dei".

Imago Dei means the image of God

In life we participate in God's divine trinitarian nature and called to belong in the community of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We are called to be in communion with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. To exercise our human dignity is to acknowledge ourselves as being made on the image of God.
### Exodus
>"I have seen the misery of my people who are in Egypt. I have heard their cry on account of their taskmasters. Indeed, I know their sufferings and I have come down to deliver them from the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey." Exodus 3:4–8

In this story, God pitied the Israelites and saved them from Egyptian slavery through Moses.

God has pity for human suffering, especially those who wishes people to be liberated and to live a life of dignity.

All forms of enslavement and oppression are a mockery to God's will as a creator of humanity and his own image. Human suffering is not the will of God but is something we should work to abolish and fight against.

God's will is done on earth when the conditions for truly humane existence are created. When we make the world the best it can be, can we truly say that God's will is done
### Gospels
> "The spirit of the lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring glad tidings to the poor, He has sent me to proclaim liberty to captives and recovery of sight to the blind, and to let the oppressed go free and to proclaim a year acceptable to the Lord." Luke 4:18–19

Jesus proclamation of the Gospels was anchored on the liberation of the oppressed (slaves, laborers, sinners, women, children, etc.).

When Jesus proclaims about the Kingdom of God, He does not refer to one with an authoritarian and tyrannical authority. He speaks of a just king who could mediate the justice of God.

The image of the Kingdom of God implied an environment in which good can flourish and in which every human being can find peace, justice, freedom.

Jesus proclaimed a blessing for those who are deprived and oppressed in society:

> "Blessed are you who are poor, for the kingdom of God is yours. Blessed are you, who are now hungry, for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you, who are now weeping for you will laugh..." - Luke 6:20–22

Jesus' act of sacrifice that granted us salvation shows our worth as children of God. Human dignity ultimately means that we are destined for God's gift of eternal life for we shared our humanity with He who rose form the dead ( Jesus ); this means we can share in the resurrection of Jesus in the Kingdom of God.
### Other Scriptural Bases 
>"God loves the orphan, the widow, and the stranger." - Deuteronomy 10:17–19

>"God formed each of us and knows us intimately." - Psalms 139:13–16

>"The Lord is the maker of both rich and poor." - Proverb 22:2

>"Honor the poor." - James 2:1–8
## The Basic Truth About the Person
We are created by God out of love. This means that we are inherently valuable to God and His love for us is his free choice.

We are created in the image and likeness of God. This means we share in God's rationality and creativity, we must use and exercise these traits as stewards for God's creations.

We are gifted with freedom. This means we have the capacity to determine our own lives and it gives more weight and value to the good we do; our freedom is perfected in our self-actualization.

We are redeemed by Christ. Jesus' sacrifice on the cross showed God's solidarity with us, his people. He showed that we are worth saving and that He is one with our suffering.
## Three Dimensions of Faith
### Doctrine
Doctrine focuses on the question: "What can we know?" and refers to act of believing in God.

This dimension centers on our creed–– our set of beliefs; and that is why this dimension inherently takes place in our mind.

This dimension is what urges us to know more about God and this is valuable to us in our genuine personal maturity.
### Morals
Morals focuses on the question: "What should I do?" and refers to the act of doing God's will.

This dimension focuses on the Decalogue ( The 10 Commandments ). This dimension is enacted by our will and our hands, for that is our means of exercising the Father's will.

This dimension is what urges us to serve God and is valuable to us by allowing us to properly exercise our freedom.
### Worship
Worship focuses on the question: "What should I hope for?" and refers to the act of entrusting to God.

This dimension focuses on our prayers and love for God. This dimension is enacted by our hearts, because in our love for God can we hope to receive His blessings.

This dimension is what urges us to love God and is valuable to us by giving us Spiritual Joy.
