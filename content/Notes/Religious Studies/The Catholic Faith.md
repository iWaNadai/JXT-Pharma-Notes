# Main Discussion
## What is Catholic Faith
[[#^ba107f|Faith]] is described as th act of offering your belief in God.

[[#^e4a4c4|Christian Faith]] is defined as a variation of faith centered on the God revealed to us by Jesus Christ.

[[#^2cc8aa|Catholic Christian Faith]] means believing Christ reveals God to us through the Catholic Church, the body of Christ, united in the Holy Spirit.

"To believe" means realizing that God is calling to us to share his divine life. Faith is our personal response as disciples of Christ of acccepting Him as "our Lord and Savior".
## Obedience of Catholic Faith
[[#^d79a89|To obey]] in the Catholic Christian Faith is to submit freely to the word that has been heard, because its truth is guaranteed by God, who is Truth itself.
 
Abraham is the model of such obeddience offered to us by Sacred Scripture for freely submitting and offering his son with no doubt nor hesitation.
## Total and Absolute Faith
[[#^c41b33|Total and absolute faith]] is a characteristic of Catholic Christian Faith mainly in the act of trusting in the ressurection of the Son.

We have this faith because He alone offers us this salvation. Total absolute faith calls for use to submit total and absolute adherence to Him and His word.

The Old Testament contrasted faith "in man in whom there is no salvation" with faith in "the Lord who made heaven and earth... who shall reign forever" (cf. Psalms 146:3,5–6,10; Jeremiah: 17:5–8). Only Faith in God calls for a total and absolute adherence (cf. CCC 150). Christ himself provides, especially in his Passion, DEath, and Resurrection, the best example of this total and absolute commitment to God.
## Faith is a Grace
Faith is a gift of God, a supernatural virtue infuesd by Him, "Before this faith can be exercised, man must have the grace of God to move and assist him; he must have the interior helps of the Holy Spirit, who moves the heart and converts it to God, who opens the eyes of the mind and makes it easy for all to accept and believe the truth." (CCC 153)
## Freedom of Faith
The act of faith is of is very nature a free act. Christ invited people to his church but never coerced them.

>"God calls men to serve him in spirit and in truth, consequently, they are bound to him in conscience, but not coerced... This fact received its fullest manifestation in Christ Jesus... For he bore witness to the truth but refused to us force to impose it on those who spoke against it. His kingdom... grows by the love with which Christ, lifted up on the crooss, draws men to himself." - CCC 160 
## Perseverance of Faith
This aspect of Catholic Christian Faith means to live, grow, and persevere in the faith until the end.

We must nourish it with the word of God; we must beg the Lord to increase our faith; it must  be working through charity, abounding in hopr, and roote in the faith of the Church.
## Trinitarian
As Christians our faith is directed to the Triune God revealed by the Son, Jesus Christ. Our Catholic Christian Faith is the manifestation of our friendship with Christ, The Father, and the Holy Spirit through Christ. Christ was a witness of the Father through his preaching and teaching, especially through Christ's passion, death, and resurrection.
## Loving, Maturing, and Missionary
Our Catholic Christian Faith can only mature through love, for:

>"the man without love has known nothing of God, for God is love" - 1 Jn 4:8

To be Christian our love must be inseparable from God and from our neighbor, like Christ; this implis our mission is to evangelize and to spread the love of God through evangelization.

To truly enact our faith, we must live our life as a missionary to show the authenticity of our faith. It is unthinkable for us to believe in Christ's word without bearing witness and proclaiming it in th act of evangelization.
## Inculturated
The [[#^2cc8aa|Catholic Christian Faith]] is never separated from the typical Filipino faith culture. Our daily life in our respective cultures are affected by our [[#^2cc8aa|Catholic Christian Faith]]; in simple terms, it is inherently involved in our culture as a society. 

The faith we have for God is inherently the source of the faith and love we share for our family, friends, and neighbors.

>"This is how all will know you for my disciples: your love for one another" - John 13:35
