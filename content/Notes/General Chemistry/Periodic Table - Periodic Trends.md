According to [[Periodic Table - Basics and Brief History#Periodic Law|Periodic Law]], arranging our elements in increasing atomic number ( like how it is arranged in the Periodic Table ), we begin to see patterns in the elemental characteristics, that is called a Periodic Trend.
# Blocks
Blocks are sections of the periodic table that share the same orbitals their valence electrons orbit.

- *S Block*
	- These are elements that share the s orbital as their valence electron orbital.
 - *P Block*
	- These are elements that share the p orbital as their valence electron orbital.
- *D Block*
	- These are elements that share the d orbital as their valence electron orbital.
- *F Block*
	- These are elements that share the f orbital as their valence electron orbital.s
# Group A vs Group B
Groups are divided into two groups; group A, the representative elements; and group B, the transition elements.

Representative elements are often found in the S block and P block, whereas the transition elements are found in the D and F blocks.
# Periodic Trends
## Electronegativity
Electronegativity is the tendency for an atom of a given chemical element to attract shared electrons when forming a chemical bond.

The difference in electronegativity between two elements in a bond will determine its type of bond and its strength.

| Type of Bond       | Difference in Electronegativity |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Non-Polar Covalent | $0-0.4$                         |
| Polar Covalent     | $0.4â€“2$                         |
| Ionic Bonds        | $>2$                            |

Electronegativity increases as you move from left to right ( $\rightarrow$ ) and as you move up a group ( $\uparrow$ ).
## Ionization Energy
Ionization Energy is the amount of energy that is required to remove a valence electron from an isolated atom in a gaseous state.

Ionization Energy increases as you move from left to right ( $\rightarrow$ ) and as you move up a group ( $\uparrow$ ).
## Electron Affinity
Electron Affinity is the tendency to more easily accept electrons and form negative ions or anions.

Electron Affinity increases as you move from left to right ( $\rightarrow$ ) and as you move up a group ( $\uparrow$ ).
## Atomic Radius
Atomic Radius is the total distance from the nucleus of an atom to the outmost orbital of its electrons.

Atomic radius increases you move right to left ( $\leftarrow$ ) and as move down a group ( $\downarrow$ ).
 Metallic Character
Metallic Character is the tendency to lose an electron in a bond and form positive ions or cations.

Metallic Character increases as you move from right to left ( $\rightarrow$ ) and as you move down a group ( $\downarrow$ ).

# Three Elemental Type
## Metals
Metals are elements in the periodic table that have the tendency to lose electrons and be great conductors of heat and electricity.

The traits of metals are the following:
- Form cations (lose electron/s)
- Metallic luster
- Good conductors (heat and electricity)
- Malleable and ductile
- High melting point
- Solid at room temperature
## Non Metals
Nonmetals are elements in the periodic table that have the tendency to gain electrons and form anions.

The traits of nonmetals are the following:
- Form anions (gain electron/s)
- Not metallic
- Brittle as solids
- Good insulators
- Low melting point
- Can be solid, liquid, or gas
## Metalloids
These are elements whose properties are intermediate between those of metals and solid nonmetals
