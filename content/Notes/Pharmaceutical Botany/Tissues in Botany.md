# Types of Tissue Systems
Flowering plants— like other multicellular organisms —are highly organized with intricate structures, into parts with varying specializations.

These structures may be referred to as the morphological[^morphology] parts of a plant. The morphologyof a plant can be used to determine the specialization of that specific part.

[^morphology]: **Morphology** refers to the form of living things; in this context: the form of plants.

The most recognizable morphological unit is a cell[^cell], which can group and unite together in the form of tissues[^tissue].

[^cell]: **Cells** are the most easy to recognize morphological unit.
[^tissue]: **Tissues** are a unit of life that is comprised of cells; they have a specific purpose and role.

Tissues are a groups of cells united together to perform a specific role and specialization.

For example: Vascular tissues[^vasculartissues] are mainly there for the conduction and transportation of water and nutrients throughout the plant.

[^vasculartissues]: **Vascular Tissues** are used for the conduction and transportation of water and nutrients in a plant.

Plant tissues are generally classified into two categories:
- Permanent tissues[^permanenttissues]
- Merismetic tissues[^merismetictissues]
## Merismetic Tissue
Meristmetic tissues are composed of young cells which have the ability to divide and multiply.

These cells are present in points of growth like the tips of roots, shoots, and epidermis. They are tightly packed with no intercellular space.

[^merismetictissues]: **Merismetic Tissues** cells responsible for growth; capable of dividing and multiplying.
## Permanent Tissue
Permanent Tissues are composed of living or dead cells that have reached maturity and cannot grow or change in size.

They are usually present in the ground tissues and comprise fundamental tissue systems. They arrangement has intercellular space.

[^permanenttissues]: **Permanent Tissues** are tissues that cannot change in size or multiply; comprises fundamental tissue systems.
# Dermal Tissue System
Dermal tissues[^dermaltissues] are on the outer most part of a plant and is responsible for creating a protective covering.

[^dermaltissues]: **Dermal Tissues** comprise the outer visible layer of plants; responsible for protection.
## Epidermis
The epidermal tissue system[^epidermaltissues] come from the dermatogen[^dermatogen] of the apical meristem[^apicalmeristem].

[^epidermaltissues]: **Epidermal Tissues** make up the outer layer of the plant body; provide protection to the plant body.
[^dermatogen]: **Dermatogens** are the outer layers of meristematic tissues that forms epidermal tissues.
[^apicalmeristem]: **Apical meristems** are the points of growth on the tips of plants.

This outermost layer extends over the entire surface of the plant body; this system is composed of a single later of flattened cell, with straight, wavy, or beaded walls covered with a layer of cutin[^cutin].

[^cutin]: **Cutin** is the layer that covers the walls of epidermal tissue cells.

The functions of the epidermis is the following:
- protection of the internal tissue from external factors such as:
	- intense temperatures,
	- mechanical injury,
	- aggressive organisms, and
	- weather.
- prevention of excess water evaporation through the use of cuticles[^cuticles], wax, and other depositions.
- protection agains intense illumination and heat through the use of cuticles and cutinized hairs[^cutinizedhairs].
- acts as a storage for water.
- minor functions such as:
	- photosynthesis
	- secretion, etc.

[^cuticles]: **Cuticles** are thin layers composed of cutin that covers the epidermis.
[^cutinizedhairs]: **Cutinized Hairs** are hair-like protrusions that are coated in cutin.
## Stomata
Stomatas[^stomata] are small minute openings in the epidermis surrounded by two kidney shaped cells called guard cells[^guardcells].

The term stoma[^stoma] is often referring to a stomatal arrangement, which is a slit like opening with guard cells.

The cells surrounding the stomata are called neighboring cells or subsidiary cells[^subsidiarycells], they often resemble other epidermal cells but varies on the species plant.

[^stomata]: **Stomatas** are small openings in the epidermis surrounded by two guard cells; responsible for gaseous exchange and transpiration.
[^guardcells]: **Guard cells** are kidney shaped cells that appear in pairs around the opening of a stomata.
[^stoma]: **Stoma** is a term that refers to the arrangement of a stomata.
[^subsidiarycells]: **Subsidiary cells** or neighboring cells are the epidermal cells that surround the stomata.

The function of the stomata[^stomata] is to facilitate gaseous exchange and transpiration in the plant body. 

The distribution of stomatas differ on the species and varieties of plants.
- The stomatas are most abundant in lower epidermis[^epidermaltissues] of dorsiventral leaf[^dorsiventralleaf].
- In isobilateral leaves[^isobilateralleaf], the stomatas are only present in the upper epidermis.
- In submerged leaves[^submergedleaves], no stomatas are present.
- In Buchu and Neem[^buchuandneem], stomatas are only present in the lower surface.
- In Belladonna, Datura, and Senna[^belladonnadaturasenna], stomatas are present on both surfaces.

The functions of the trichomes is:
- to prevent any damage from insects,
- to prevent materials form clogging the stomatas,
- to aid in the dispersion of seeds,
- secretion of volatile oils.

[^trichomes]: **Trichomes** are elongated epidermal cells; prevents damage from insects and clogging of the stomata; aids in the dispersion of seeds and secretion of volatile oils.

[^coveringtrichomes]: **Covering trichomes** or clothing trichomes cover the plant body.
[^glandulartrichomes]: **Glandular trichomes** secrete volatile oils on their tips.

## Periderm
The periderm[^peridem] is the layers directly beneath the epidermis or phellogen[^phellogen] that divide and redivide.

The cells that divide towards the epidermis form brick-shaped or polygonal cork[^cork], and the cells that divide away from the epidermis form perenchymatous phelloderm[^phelloderm].

Lenticels[^lenticels] are present in the periderm and function similar to the stomata.

[^perderm]: The **Peridem** is the cells that divide from the phellogen.
