# Mitosis[^mitosis]
Mitosis is the type of cell division that is used to replicate existing cells and produce exact copies.

Mitosis is used when an organism needs to heal wounds, grow, or to replace old cells.

[^mitosis]: **Mitosis** is the process a cell takes to produce an exact copy of itself; for healing and growing;
## Phases of Mitosis
Mitosis is composed of two major phases: the interphase and the mitotic phase.
### Interphase[^interphasemit]
In interphase, the cell is preparing for division. Interphase is composed of three phases.

[^interphasemit]: **Interphase** is the preparatory phase of cells before division.
#### G1 Phase[^g1phasemit]
The G1 phase is where the organelles, proteins, and centrioles[^centrioles] replicate to accommodate the two daughter cells[^daughtercells]

[^centrioles]: **Centrioles** are organelles that organize spindle fibers during mitosis.
[^g1phasemit]: **G1 Phase** is when the cell replicates its organelles and centrioles, and increases its protein supply.
[^daughtercells]: **Daughter cells** are the two new cells produced after cell division.
#### S Phase[^sphasemit]
The S phase is where DNA replication takes place.

During the S phase, the DNA uncoiled by enzymes to allow free deoxyribonucleotides[^deoxyribonucleotides] to bond and create 2 copies of the same DNA.

[^deoxyribonucleotides]: **Deoxyribonucleotides** are the components that form DNA.
[^sphasemit]: **S Phase** is when DNA is replicated.
#### G2 Phase[^g2phasemit]
The G2 phase is when the cell doubles in size and the centriole finish replicating.

This is the step taken directly before the mitotic phase.

[^g2phasemit]: **G2 Phase** is when the cell doubles in size and the centrioles finish replicating.

### Mitotic Phase[^mitoticphase]
The mitotic phase is the final phase of cell division and consists of five major parts.

In the mitotic phase, two major events occur: mitosis— the division of the nucleus, and cytokinesis[^cytokinesis]— division of the cytoplasm

[^mitoticphase]: **Mitotic Phase** is when the begins mitosis or the division of the nucleus.
[^cytokinesis]: **Cytokinesis** is the division of the cytoplasm.

#### Prophase[^prophasemit]
In prophase, the chromatin[^chromatin] are condensed further into chromosomes[^chromosomes]. 

The centrioles begin to move to opposite poles of the cell, forming spindle fibers[^spindlefibers].

The nuclear membrane[^nuclearenvelope] also disappears; freeing the chromosomes.

[^spindlefibers]: **Spindle fibers** are microtubules that separate the chromosomes.
[^nuclearenvelope]: The **Nuclear Envelope** is a membrane that surround the nucleus.
[^prophasemit]: **Prophase** is the first stage of the mitotic phase.
[^chromatin]: **Chromatin** is tightly packed DNA.
[^chromosomes]: **Chromosomes** are tightly packed chromatins.
#### Metaphase[^metaphasemit]
In metaphase, the chromosomes are attached to the spindle fibers and are aligned in the equatorial plate[^equatorialplate].

[^equatorialplate]: **Equatorial plate** is the center of the cell in between the centrioles.
[^metaphasemit]: **Metaphase** is the second stage of the mitotic phase.
#### Anaphase[^anaphasemit]
In anaphase, the chromosomes are pulled apart and separated by the spindle fibers and are pulled to opposite poles of the cell.

[^anaphasemit]: **Anaphase** is the third stage of the mitotic phase.
#### Telophase[^telophasemit]
In telophase, new nuclear envelopes develop around the separated chromosomes, and the chromosomes begin to uncoil back into chromatins.

[^telophasemit]: **Telophase** is the fourth stage of the mitotic phase.
#### Cytokinesis
Cytokinesis is the fifth and last step of the mitotic phase and overlaps in occurrence with telophase. In this phase, the cytoplasm is separated into two, forming two new identical daughter cells.
# Meiosis[^meiosis]
Meiosis is the type of cell division that produces four partial copies of a cell.

The daughter cells produced share only a part of the mother cell's DNA, and each only has half of the chromosomes a human cell must have.

This type of cell division is used by gametes[^gametes] or sex cells; and have less chromosomes and only partial traits to allow the mixing of traits from mother and father.

The produced daughter cells are called haploid cells[^haploid].

[^haploid]: **Haploid cells** are cells that contain only half of the genetic materials cells have.
[^meiosis]: **Meiosis** is the process that a sex cell takes that gives four daughter cells with only half the DNA.
[^gametes]: **Gametes** are sex cells.

The first phases of meiosis are the same as meiosis, having an interphase and mitotic phase, but the mitotic phases are followed by a number that differentiates them (prophase I, metaphase I, etc.)

One key difference is that in prophase I, crossing over[^crossingover] occurs which is when the chromosome come into contact and exchange genetic material. This process creates genetic variation.

[^crossingover]: **Crossing over** is the process where chromosomes exchange generic material; occurs during prophase I in meiosis.

After mitosis I, mitosis II[^mitosisii] follows; it has the same process as mitosis, except there is no DNA replication done, and therefor it produced haploid cells.

[^mitotisii]: **Mitosis II** is the second phase of meiosis where the two daughter cells are divided into four haploid daughter cells.
