# What is Taxonomy
In biology and its sub-sciences (such as botany), classifies organisms into a groups and sub groups that helps in identifying species that does not cause confusion.

This system is called taxonomy. From the greek word *taxis*, meaning arrangement; and the greek suffix *-nomia*, meaning method.

# Taxonomic Hierarchy
![[Taxonomic Hierarchy.jpg]]

In Taxonomy, organisms are classified into a group in each of the ranks of taxonomy; this is how we generate names that maintain an adequate degree of specificity.

The names for each group under each taxonomic rank often share a consistent naming convention, and it is illustrated in the table below.

Note: Italicized ranks are sub ranks.

| Rank         | Suffix   | Example                         |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| Domain       | -----    | Eukarya                         |
| Kingdom      | -----    | Plantae                         |
| Phylum       | -phyta   | Magnoliophyta                   |
| *Subphylum*  | -phytina | Magnoliophytina                 |
| Class        | -opsida  | Asteropsida                     |
