# Plants and Life
Humans and plant-life have been interacting since the dawn of human society. Plants hold a very significant and influential role in our history; being the subject of wars, source of food, clothing, and expression.

Plants have been known to be valuable resource that made civilizations wage wars for the right to its sources; one example is the First Opium War  ($1839-1842$).

Plants is also a very essential source of food for many if not all civilizations; about $95\%$ of our food comes from only twenty species of plants; $80\%$ of our food comes from six of those species of plants.

Plastics, clothing, oils, adhesives, and other useful components are derived from plants in one way or another.
# Botany
The massive role that plants play in our society a well as the general curiosity we possess for plant spawned the field of botany.

Botany is an exciting and thriving science that deals with all things plants. 

The term botany is derived from the greek words *botane*, meaning plant or grass; and *botanikos*, meaning herbs;

## A Botanist's View of Life
Just like other scientists, botanists share an insatiable curiosity for the major questions in their fields.

> "How are plants constructed?"

>"How do plants work?"

>"How did plants get here?"

>"Why are plants important?"

The four questions above are the general questions that most questions in botany fall under. To answer these questions, botanists, like other scientists use the [[#Scientific Method]].
## Scientific Method
The scientific method is a framework for systematically answering a question while properly addressing expected data and acquired data.

The process is as follows
1. ***Observation***
	- Observe and note behaviors and characteristics.
2. ***Question***
	- Question something about your observation.
3. ***Research*** 
	- Research information about your observation.
4. ***Hypothesize*** 
	 - Construct an adequate hypothesis.
5. ***Experiment***
	 - Test your hypothesis.
6. ***Analysis***
	 - Analyze and compare your acquired results with your expected results.
7. ***Conclusion*** 
	- Finalize a conclusions from your findings 
## What is a Plant?
We all have our own understandings of what a plant is: a quiet organism with green leaves, a central stem, an underground root system, and the ability to bear flowers.

Despite the aforementioned characteristics being true for most plants, there are a wide array of exemptions.

Conifers are plants that bear no flowers but cones.

Moss are plants that don't bear a central stem.
## Scientific Names in Botany
Scientific names are a means to specify a group of organisms (in botany's case: plants) into names that will not cause confusion.

Ex. Cherries bear the scientific name: *Prunus avium*.

Take note the following rules.
- Scientific names are written in italics when types.
- Scientific names are underlined when written by hand.
- A scientific name consists of a generic name (this comes first) and a special epithet (this comes last).
- The generic name must have its first letter capitalized.
- The special epithet must be in lowercase.

## What is Natural Selection
Natural selection refers to the phenomenon that is the driving mechanism of evolution. It is essentially how nature naturally selects which animals get to live and spread their genetics.

If an ecosystem's only viable and sustainable source of food are tall trees; animals would die out except for those with long necks or other capabilities to gain nutrients from trees. Those animals that don't die of starvation are then able to breed and pass on their traits that allow them to eat and survive in that ecosystem. This is what natural selection is.
