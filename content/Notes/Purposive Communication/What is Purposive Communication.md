# Purposive Communication
Is a type of communication that takes place with a purpose in mind.

Those five purposes are:
1. Informing
2. Expressing feelings
3. Imagining
4. Influencing
5. Meeting social expectations

when you utilize purposive communications, you plan and execute a communication process to fulfill any of these purposes.

It is the spreading of a message of communication or an idea to a specific group of audiences in the best-suited formats and through the right channels.

While there can be different forms such as oral and written, but the messages that are being shared are properly formatted and structured to serve the inherent purpose.
