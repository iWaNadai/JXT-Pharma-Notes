# Varieties of Register of Spoken and Written Language
A variety refers to any variant of a language which can be sufficiently delimited from one another.

is a new language which develops in situations where speakers of different languages need to communicate but do not share a common language.

A lexifier is a particular language where the vocabulary of a pidgin comes from.
### Creole
It is a pidgin that becomes the first language of the children and the mother tongue of a community.
### Regional Dialect
It is not a distinct language but a variety of a language spoken in a particular area of a country.
### Minority Dialect
It is a variety used as a marker of identity, usually alongside a standard variety, by the members of a
particular minority ethnic group.
### Indigenized Varieties
These are spoken mainly as second languages in ex-colonies with multilingual populations.
## Types of Registers
### Frozen
It refers to historic language or communication that is intended to remain unchanged, like a constitution or a prayer.

It is used in professional, academic, or legal settings where communication is expected to be respectful, uninterrupted, and restrained. Slang is never used and contractions are rare.
### Consultative
It is used in conversation when they are speaking with someone who has specialized knowledge or who is offering advice. Tone is often respectful (use of courtesy titles), but may be more casual if the relationship is longstanding or friendly.
### Casual
It is used when they are with friends, close acquaintances and co-workers, and family.
### Intimate
It is reserved for special occasions, usually between only two people and often in private
