# Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci Sequence is a sequence of numbers created by [[#Fibonacci]] and involves starting with the numbers $0$ and $1$, followed by adding the two previous numbers together to form the next number.

$$0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34\dots$$

## Fibonacci
He is a medieval Italian mathematician, he was born in the year 1770 and died after the year 1240. He is well known for his Fibonacci Sequence; which is often described as a sequence that is intrinsic to nature itself.
## Golden Ratio
The Golden Ratio, denoted as Greek letter Phi ( $\varphi$ or $\phi$ ), is the ratio observed in the [[#Fibonacci Sequence]] and is defined algebraically as:

$$\frac{a+b}{a}=\varphi\text{ where } a>b>0$$

The actual value for the Golden ratio can be calculated through this equation:

$$\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}=\varphi$$
# The Fibonacci in the World 
The [[#Fibonacci Sequence]] has gained its popularity from its shocking appearances in the fields of nature, music, and many more

## Fibonacci in Nature 
The [[#Fibonacci Sequence]] is observed in nature through various examples, below are two examples.

The number of petals in flowers ( especially daisies) are examples of the [[#Fibonacci Sequence]] in nature because the two most often coincide.

![[Fibonacci Pinecones.jpg]]

In the example above, the number of spirals observed on a pinecone going in one direction is a Fibonacci number, and the number of spirals in the opposite direction is an adjacent Fibonacci number.

## Fibonacci in Music
The [[#Fibonacci Sequence]] surprisingly appears in the field of music through notable compositions from popular composers such as:
- Bach (1685–1750)
- Beethoven (1770–1827)
- Mozart (1756–1791)
